This tool allows users to selectively or entirely leave Discord servers using a graphical interface. Users input their Discord user token to log in, which the tool then uses to fetch all servers they’re a part of. The servers are displayed with their names and icons, allowing users to:

Select Specific Servers: Check the servers you wish to leave and hit the “Confirm” button to exit only those selected servers.

Save Server Icons: Each server listed has a “Save Icon” button to download and save the server’s profile picture.

Leave All Servers: For a more drastic measure, the “Leave All Servers” button allows users to exit all servers at once. A confirmation prompt ensures no accidental exits.

It’s user-friendly and makes managing server memberships a breeze! 

Installation Instructions:
bash


pip install discord.py-self
pip install pillow
Give it a whirl and manage your Discord servers with ease! 




PS: i don't want to steal passwords or accounts, i provided the .py script so you can look through it without downloading the main .zip file. and if discord wants me to take it down i will, i only made this so it's easyier to leave servers if you have joined a lot.
